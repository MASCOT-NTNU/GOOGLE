# Goal
I was trying out different combinations to make the webpage work so that I can continue documenting while I am developing new modules. 

# Methods
I moved *Jekyll* out from the docs folder and then the whole repo is a big website repo now containing everything for the long horizon mission. 

# Achievements
I feel so relieved now! But I am will continue making it look more nicely.
