- Q3:
  - We updated Ref [32] with "Department of vehicle and maritime engineering."
- Q4:
  - We updated Ref [33] with "(Vol.3, No. 3.2, p.5)" in the end.
- Q5:
  - We updated the year for the M.Sc. degree to be in 2020, and Ph.D. degree in statistics.

Additionally, we updated some minor mistakes:
- Page 1, 77034 -> 7034
- # 144, in -> In
- # 277, changed S_{j-1} to S_j.
- # 297, changed S_{j-1} to S_j.
- After # 297, we added "The bivariate $\Phi_2$ calculation in (10) is somewhat costly, and if the correlation term is small, one could approximate it with two univariate calculations to gain computational efficiency."
