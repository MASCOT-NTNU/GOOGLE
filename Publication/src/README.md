# Long horizon path planning in Douro River.

# Important notes
- `resume_flag.txt` is the file read by the system and it automatically resumes the mission if it is set to be a non-zero number. Or else it will be set to False.
- `counter.txt` saves the integer value used for saving the waypoint numbers that the system has been through. 
- Remember to clean the folder in GRF so that all files are deleted in the beginning before the mission is launched.
