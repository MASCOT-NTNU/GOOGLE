# Notes for data generated during the simulation.

- `CV` contains data for cost valley study
- `RRT` contains data for rrt star simulation study. 

- "EIBV.npy" saves the data for the case where EIBV has higher dominance.
- "IVR.npy" saves the data for the case where IVR has higher dominance.
- "EQUAL.npy" saves the data when both shares the same weights.
