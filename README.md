GOOd GLobal Extented-horizon path planning


# Usage:
- `run gridGenerator` to get the coordinates within constraints.
- `run datainterpolator` to extract data from SINMOD to those coordinates.
-

# Notes:
- `Starting location` [64.43402, 10.36401]
- `Ending location` [63.45546, 10.43784]
63.43990, 10.35273
# TODO
- Check simulation results compared with other methods
- Make it work on Nidelva case
- Make replicate study results
